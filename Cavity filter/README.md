# 4.3 GHz Cavity filter
In any heterodyne receiver, the first mixer is followed by the best possible bandpass filter. At low frequencies, this can be a crystal or ceramic filter with a center frequency of a few 10 MHz. A spectrum analyzer works similarly, except that the frequencies are much higher. As the value of the first intermediate frequency is 4.3 GHz in our case, we are limited to cavity resonators or filter on printed circuit board. The latter are a popular industrial process choice since they are simple to make, can be fitted inside a multilayer circuit (the top and bottom layers are completely covered in copper, providing appropriate shielding), and are supported by contemporary simulation tools. Unfortunately, those resonators have a fairly low Q-unloaded factor that does not reach a value much higher than 100 (at frequencies above 1 GHz), both due to dielectric and conductor losses.

Cavity resonators are larger and heavier, and require more time and material to manufacture, but their Q factor (quality) is much higher. This can reach a value of 1000 for quarter-wave coaxial resonators and exceed 10000 for larger cavities. At the optical frequencies this quality reaches 10^8 and above!
At first glance, they are simple devices, but they often require special tools (lathes) for production, or the production process is very expensive (aluminum milling).  Finding a resonator design that can also be implemented in a home workshop using basic tools (drill, saw, bench drill) makes sense for our measuring device.

The dielectric losses of the cavity resonator are immeasurable. Electrical losses are lowest for cylindrical shapes. On the other hand, these losses are large for thin microstrip printed circuit connections. A good choice is therefore to use rectangular profiles and solid aluminum rods, which are available in all hardware stores.
All resonators can exhibit a series of high order resonances (in addition to the desired one), which should be sensibly taken into account during planning. In the case of electric cavity resonators, the unwanted frequency response can be very close to the operating frequency. Which profile dimensions to choose also depends on the corner frequency for propagation of the first order wave (in a rectangular waveguide). Given the available profiles, a size of 20x20 mm with a wall thickness of 1.5 mm makes sense at a frequency of 4.3 GHz. The diameter of the aluminum solid rods, which are still adequate for tapping the M3 thread, is 6 mm. All components can be cut to the desired dimensions with a handsaw without the use of special tools.

There are two ways to implement the resonator. Interdigital (resonators facing alternately in one direction or another) or comb (all resonators facing the same direction). In both cases, an electric and magnetic coupling is established between the resonators, except that the value of the phase of the magnetic coupling in the interdigital mode changes sign between the resonators. Since the electric coupling leads 90 electrical degrees, and the magnetic one lags behind by the same value, the influence of the magnetic and electric coupling is added, and in the case of a comb filter, it is subtracted. For the same dimensions and spacing between the resonators, the interdigital design has a stronger coupling and thus a wider bandwidth.

For the spectrum analyzer filter, we want the narrowest possible pass-band and the smallest possible design, which is made possible by the comb filter. In theory (in the case of ideal quarter-wave resonators) the magnetic and electric field would completely cancel eachouther out. In practice this does not happen, due to the effects of the open end of the resonator (capacitance) that dictates resonators shorter than Î»/4. The design of the comb resonator is shown in figure below:

![schematics](Cavity_filter_schematic.svg?raw=true "Cavity filter drawing")

The filter is designed using five 12.5 mm long resonators. These set the center frequency of the filter just above 4.3 GHz, and the fine adjustment is done with additional M3 screws from the opposite direction, which form a small adjustable capacitor with the open end of the resonator. For them, we have to cut an M3 thread into a very thin layer of aluminum (1.5 mm), so the handling is quite delicate. They are finally fixed in place with a lock nut and toothed washer. We must establish good electrical contact between the resonators and the aluminum profile, i.e. remove the oil residues when the threads are cut and grind off the sawdust. Fasten the SMA panel connector with the appropriate number of M2.5 screws at the prescribed distance (they should not extend inside more than 3 mm). If necessary, shorten the Teflon to the thickness of the profile.

The signal is coupled to the end resonators in interdigital mode (larger coupling) using a copper tube (e.g. shield of UT-085 rigit cable), which is soldered to the central connection of the SMA connector. The coupling is adjusted by choosing the length of the antennas (10 mm measured without the thickness of the aluminum!).

As the plan shows, the spacing between the different resonators is not constant! There will be a noticeable ripple in the pass-band if the spacing is equal. This is fixed by extending the spacing between the two central resonators by 4 mm. Making a filter by hand quickly results in a 1 mm inaccuracy and, as a result, a change in the coupling, which is already noticeable in the filter response. Two 20 mm M3 screws are attached from the opposite side, half the distance of the central resonators, to level out the response and so compensate for manufacturing errors. After the calibration is complete, the metal paint is applied to all of the adjustable screws.

![wide_band_response](measurements/wideband_response.svg?raw=true "Wideband filter response")

The filter given here operates at 4.3 GHz, has a bandwidth of 25 MHz (-3 dB), and a ripple of less than 0.05 dB at the center frequency (10 MHz). Depending on the precision of fabrication, the insertion loss of such a filter can approach -2 dB. At the center frequency, the return loss surpasses 15 dB. The filter's first more pronounced response at higher frequencies begins roughly at 11 GHz, and the removal of undesired components in that part is accomplished via a low-pass filter in the mixer assembly. The second mirror frequency (about 4.16 GHz) will be suppressed by more than 100 dB (depending on the intermediate frequencies used). The described filter design would also allow for a narrower frequency band than 25 MHz, however removing the ripple in the response (constant time delay) entails longer distances and consequently higher insertion loss.

The electromagnetic field reduces rapidly at both ends, therefore metal coverings are not required for operation. The metal wall can be pushed inside to a depth of 10 mm without compromising the filter's operation. The lid will prevent debris from entering. A 3D printer can also be used to create it out of [plastic](3D_holder/2x2cm_end_plug_plus_mounting.stl).
